Steps:



1. Find the Bug 



Finding the problem and checking the dropzone (the puzzle box) empty or not, 
and if it is empty; don't do anything, if it not see the 
puzzle pieces if it is necessary.

In order to reset the puzzle pieces, when we start a new game, 
make the thumbnail puzzle pictures reset buttons.





3. add the CODE



Writing the necessary function and code in the proper place and fail epically and break the whole game.
